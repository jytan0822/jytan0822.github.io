Welcome! I am Jonathan Tan, and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in Columbia University. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/">Adam Elmachtoub</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ykanoria.github.io/">Yash Kanoria</a>. Prior to joining Columbia, I recieved my bachelor's degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University in 2024.
